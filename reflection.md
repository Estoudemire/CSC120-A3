- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    The first coding language I learned was Java, so I'm quite fond of it. I like the structure of it and how there's very little that left up to interpretation. I feel like having to be so specific helps me organize myself and make sure that I'm exactly sure of what I'm asking the computer to do and what I'm expecting to get back. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Both Java and Python have the same basic building blocks (printing, data types, loops, classes, etc). The tools that both languages provide are different, but the basics are still the same, which tells you a lot about how important the basic building blocks are. 
    As for differences, the syntax for Java is a lot more strict. You have to indicate the end of each statement and specifiy data types before you use them, unlike in python. But, each method makes sense for it's respective language. 
    All the languges have their own advantages and disadvantages, so you should think about what you want your code to do before choosing a language to use. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I think the best thing to do is keep a tab open with a list of Java's syntax and built-in methods. Everything moves so much faster when you're not trying to force yourself to remember little details like where the period goes and if the method is .add or .concat. 
    Mostly, though, I'd tell someone taking this course in the future to take their time. Coding can be so much fun as long as you don't stress yourself out with it. It can be frustrating when things don't work as you intedned, but that doesn't mean you're failing. You just need to look at it from a different angle. :)
